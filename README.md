# OLL Trainer

## https://oll-trainer-s-leirbag.vercel.app/

Used to practice Rubik's cube OLL algorithms. You select which cases to practice and then time yourself on them.

It is heavily based on https://github.com/Roman-/oll_trainer by Roman Strakhov but I used React and MUI instead of pure JS. I wanted to have a manageable website I could copy using React to gain experience in React. I used lots of Roman's code: the algorithms list, scramble generation, and some program structure.

## To-do

- egg mui stats clean typescript

- Use Typescript
- Improve stats list
- Clean code, comment, refactor
- Customize timer/scramble size
- Fix selected cases not highlighting when site is first loaded
