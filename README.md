# OLL Trainer

## https://oll-trainer-s-leirbag.vercel.app/

Used to practice Rubik's cube OLL algorithms. You select which cases to practice and time them in a randomized mode and a recap mode.

It is heavily based on https://github.com/Roman-/oll_trainer by Roman Strakhov but I used React instead of pure JS. I wanted to have a manageable website I could copy using React to gain experience in React. I used lots of Roman's code: the algorithms list, scramble generation, and some program structure.

## To-do

- Move to mui
- Use Typescript
- Fix selected cases not being highlighted when site is first loaded
- Improve layout
  - Add button to change between recap and random mode
  - Add button to reset recap mode
- UI Customization
  - Add options for accent color
  - Add customization settings to all pages
  - Fix button color updating
