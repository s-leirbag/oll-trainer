# OLL Trainer

Used to practice Rubik's cube OLL algorithms. You select which cases to practice and time them in a randomized mode and a recap mode.

It's a near copy of https://github.com/Roman-/oll_trainer by Roman Strakhov but using React instead of pure JS. I wanted to have a manageable website I could copy using React to gain experience in React. I used lots of Roman's code, especially for the algorithms list, scramble generation, and program structure.

## To-do

Customize colors, improve code, turn training elements into components not just functions, improve layout, eventually change to use something like mui
